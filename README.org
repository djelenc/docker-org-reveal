* Docker org-reveal
This image contains all dependencies and scripts needed to export a presentation written in an =org= file using [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][org-reveal]] and [[https://revealjs.com][reveal.js]] to HTML.

It can be used in a CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate HTML slides from org files and publish them, for instance in a GitLabCI.
* Usage
Use scripts =org2html= and =org-reveal2html= to convert and an =org= file to a standard HTML or reveal.js presetation, respectively. For instance:

#+begin_src txt
org2html index.org # produces index.html using standard org HTML export

org-reveal2html presentation.org # produces presentation.html using reveal.js presentation
#+end_src

The script =org-reveal2html= also creates a copy of a reveal.js archive in current directory.
* Credits
Yujie Wen -- author of org-reveal and whose =Makefile= was used to produce the scripts and the =Dockerfile=.
